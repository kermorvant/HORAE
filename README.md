# HORAE

Welcome to the github instance of the HORAE research project

HORAE (Hours - Recognition, Analysis, Editions) is a cross-disciplinary research project studying religious practices and experiences in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance through the books of hours, the absolute medieval best seller. In a public-private partnership, it gathers three partners in the Humanities and Computer Science: the Institut de Recherche et d’Histoire des Textes (IRHT, UPR 841), the private company TEKLIA and the Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes (LS2N, UMR6004). Books of hours form, with more than 10’000 preserved manuscripts, a vast and crucial ensemble to understand the medieval mindset. 

We will start by establishing a corpus of books of hours worldwide and, specifically, listing the ones which are digitized and available through the IIIF protocol and providing a link to their manifests
